# mu_CNN

We aim to construct a Convolutional Neural Network for classifying DUNE neutrino interactions captured in both 3D and 2D (side-view projections derived from 3D) from a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, based on their energy levels. We are interested in an ensemble learning approach. Our initial investigation will prioritize the analysis of 2D projections before extending our study to encompass 3D.
